Our goal is to reduce the number of 3rd party dependencies.

LIBRARIES
bcm2835		// for imu (see /imu)
pigpio		// for motor driver (see /motordriver)
rt				// for motor driver
pthread		// for motor driver

3RD PARTY INCLUDES
imu/RaspberryPi_bcm2835/I2Cdev imu/RaspberryPi_bcm2835/I2Cdev/I2Cdev.cpp
imu/Arduino_MPU6050 imu/Arduino_MPU6050/MPU6050.cpp

MISCELLANEOUS
Currently using C++11 for multithreading to safely stop balance/bin/balance code
