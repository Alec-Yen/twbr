# TODO

## NOW
Write code to move forward and turn  
Use Arduino to measure batt voltage and communicate to Pi  
Take a look at no-dependency MPU6050 code at http://www.pieter-jan.com/node/15  

3D print chassis  
	Secure IMU so it is as close to aligned as possible  
		Get precise starting angle  
	Add training wheels or similar  
	3D print new mounting to put Pi and motor driver on middle layer  


## LATER:
Physically test balance_pthread code using MDD10A  
Physically test balance code using Roboclaw  
Write code to estimate position using Roboclaw encoder count (1920 counts per revolution)  



## DEAN'S SUGGESTIONS
Increase max speed  
Use encoder to account for varying surfaces  
Eventually control motors separately
