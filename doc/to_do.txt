TO DO:
Figure out how to use Pi for encoders
Measure battery voltage

3D print entire chassis
	Secure IMU so it is as close to aligned as possible
		Get precise starting angle
	Add training wheels or similar
	3D print new mounting to put Pi and motor driver on middle layer


LATER:
Write code to handle SIGINT
Add LCD screen to read angle
Switch to Roboclaw (?)
Switch from PIGPIO to WiringPi (?)


DEAN'S SUGGESTIONS
Increase max speed
Use encoder to account for varying surfaces
Eventually control motors separately
