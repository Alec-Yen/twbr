TODO:

Alec:
Write balance code using Roboclaw
Use Arduino to measure batt voltage and communicate to Pi

Understand Roboclaw encoder measurements
Take a look at no-dependency MPU6050 code at http://www.pieter-jan.com/node/15

Yaw:
3D print chassis
	Secure IMU so it is as close to aligned as possible
		Get precise starting angle
	Add training wheels or similar
	3D print new mounting to put Pi and motor driver on middle layer


LATER:
Physically test c++98 compatible code to handle interrupt for balance code



DEAN'S SUGGESTIONS
Increase max speed
Use encoder to account for varying surfaces
Eventually control motors separately
