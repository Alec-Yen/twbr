Best combo with battery at bottom: 60 .5 .5
Max Speed: 60, Sample Time: 0.01 s
Higher Kp increased oscillation speed
Higher Kd increased oscillations more?
IMU placement and tilt is CRITICAL. Need to secure
Still trying to figure out what Ki does (seems to reduce oscillations?)
Battery placement didn't make a huge difference between middle and bottom layer

Battery is best placed at the top
Best combo with battery at top: 60 .5 .5
Max Speed 70, Sample Time: 0.01 s
Writing code to get accurate sample time seemed detrimental for some reason
A "standoff" was used with the IMU to keep in place, didn't seem to do very much. It seems that there will have to be other measures taken to keep the robot from moving off in one direction completely.
